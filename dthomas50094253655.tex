\begin{abstract}
Thomas \& Kahn (2018) demonstrated, using high fidelity ray-tracing simulations, that star trail images enable wide-field ground-based telescopes to resolve stellar variability down to a time scale of 10 milliseconds. We request half a night with the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope to take star trail images of four K2 fields to validate this method, characterize its performance, and detect new sources of stellar variability and events. The 270 square degree survey will be the first of its kind and will add a new dimension to our understanding of over 10,000 sources.

\sciencejustification
% The Kepler K2 mission is a sequence of 80-day continuous observing campaigns of fields distributed around the ecliptic plane. For each field, K2 provides state of the art photometry for thousands of targets. The extensive time series data has propelled scientific investigation of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. Seeking further insights, astronomers have engaged in follow up observations of these fields on other telescopes, including in the near infrared and x-ray regimes. High time resolution imaging, or sub-second photometry, however, is absent from this data ecosystem. Imaging the universe on short time scales can bolster the investigation of energetic phenomena from compact stellar remnants such as black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs; to two star systems such as cataclysmic variables, eclipsing binaries, and X-ray binaries; to extra-solar planets and brown dwarfs.

% The universe is teaming with phenomena that manifests on short time scales but that is dificult to image. A wide range of energetic phenomena from compact stellar remnants such as black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs; to two star systems such as cataclysmic variables, eclipsing binaries, and X-ray binaries; to extra-solar planets and brown dwarfs is intriguing to examine on short time scales. 

\subsection*{Probing Short Duration Stellar Variability with Star Trails}

 Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs), the detector of choice for optical astronomy, take around 10 seconds to read out. This limits the time resolution of conventional telescopes. Dedicated instruments using special frame transfer and electron multiplying CCDs have achieved time resolution in tens of milliseconds on a 5 arcsecond field of view (Dhillon et al. 2007, 2014, 2016; Harding et al. 2016). While these instruments are sufficient for studying individual sources of variability, they are not well-suited for large surveys or searching for new sources of variability. In Thomas \& Kahn (2018), we present a technique that allows existing wide-field telescopes to achieve comparable time resolution. We propose using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4-m telescope to validate this method and to provide sub-second photometry for four strategically chosen K2 fields.

% \subsection*{Exploring the Variable Universe on Short Time Scales}
The method is comprised of operational and image processing components. The operational component is to take star trail images. Howell and Jacoby realized that each trail serves as a light curve for its corresponding source and facilitates high time resolution photometry (Howell \& Jacoby 1986). We process the noisy star trail images by training a deep neural network to identify stellar variability in simulated star trail images from the Large Synoptics Survey Telescope. The network detection efficiency on tophat-like flares is shown in Figure \ref{fig:1}. 

The Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope is the best instrument to validate our method on because it has a wide field of view and superb resolution. The 2.2 degree field of view captures many sources simultaneously and allows us to survey the sky around 700 times faster than existing high time resolution instruments. The wide field is complemented by a 570 Megapixel camera and 0.26 arcsecond pixel scale which mean that a trailing source will spend approximately $17 / \cos(\delta)$ milliseconds over each pixel, fostering excellent time resolution. After validating and further refining our method on DECam we hope to employ it during the commissioning of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. 

The proposed survey is the first of its kind and will add a new dimension to our knowledge of the four chosen K2 fields. The analysis we will pursue is contingent on what we uncover. Detections of M-dwarf flares in open clusters would allow us to constrain their frequency, correlate them with cluster properties, and compare high time resolution photometry of the flare up with numerical simulations. Occultations from Trans-Neptunian Objects would allow us to detect new structures in the solar system. The small Kuiper Belt Objects that are of particular theoretical interest, would produce occultations lasting for tens of milliseconds. Finally, perhaps the most intriguing possibility is that we will discover new sources of variability.


% The proposed survey will get star trails over a wide swathe of sky. This will allow us to accurately measure M-dwarf flares and constrain their frequency across the X,Y,Z open clusters. TNO occultations can also help us discover new TNO objects. The most intriguing possibility is discovering a new source of variability.


% Kepler fields have been extensively studied. Often times there are synergies between these studies that complement each other. However no mechanism to study short term optical variability. 

% Most of our understanding of what causes a star to flare is based on observations of the only star near enough to examine in detail — the Sun. But in learning from a sample size of one, a challenge arises: we must determine which conclusions are unique to the Sun (or Sun-like stars), and which apply to other stellar types as well.

% Stellar flares are good observational tracers of magnetic
% activity in low-mass stars (especially M dwarfs), since the
% intense release of flare energy is necessarily related to magnetic
% fields that are generated by dynamo process as on the Sun.


% compact object physics that manifests on short time scales. Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs), the detector of choice for optical astronomy, take around 10 seconds to read out which limits the time resolution they can achieve. Dedicated instruments such as ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC, HIPERCAM, and CHIMERA have achieved sample rates up to tens of hertz on a 5 arcsecond field of view by employing special frame transfer and electron multiplying CCDs (Dhillon et al. 2007, 2014, 2016; Harding et al. 2016). While these instruments can study known sources of variability they are not well-suited for discovering new sources of variability or constraining global frequencies. In Thomas \& Kahn (2018), we present a new technique that allows existing wide-field telescopes to achieve comparable time resolution and to systematically survey the sky in this regime.

% Our method consists of operational and image processing components. The operational component is to take star trail images. Howell and Jacoby realized that each trail serves as a light curve for its corresponding source and facilitates high time resolution photometry (Howell \& Jacoby 1986). We process the noisy star trail images by training a deep neural network to identify stellar variability. We used the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Photon Simulator to generate simulated star trail images and include transient bursts as a proxy for variability (\textit{PhoSim}, Peterson 2014; Peterson et al. 2015). The network detection efficiency curves in Figure \ref{fig:1} show that it is capable of identifying transient bursts on timescales down to 10 milliseconds. The next step is to validate and characterize this technique on real wide-field star trail images.

% The Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope is the best instrument for validating our method because it has both a wide field of view and superb resolution. The 2.2 degree field of view captures many sources and allows us to survey the sky around 700 times faster than existing high time resolution instruments. Figure \ref{fig:2} shows the predicted number of sources in a DECam image against galactic latitude. The wide field is complemented by a 570 Megapixel camera and 0.26 arcsecond pixel scale. The time it takes a point source to trail over a single pixel, assuming a 15 arcsecond per second rotation of the Earth, is $~ 17 / \cos(\delta)$ milliseconds, where $\delta$ is the declination. For observations with a small declination, this instrument is capable of sampling sources at close to 60 Hz. After further refining our method on DECam we look to employ it during the commissioning of LSST. 

% There is a wide range of phenomena that can be better studied with high time resolution in the optical regime: compact stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars, eclipsing binary stars, X-ray binary stars, extra-solar planets, flare stars, active galactic nuclei, asteroseismology, atmospheres of solar system objects, and Trans-Neptunian objects (Hubbard et al. 1988; Dhillon et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2013). Our method allows existing wide field telescopes to join a select group of instrumetns with this capability. Furthermore, it allows us to systematically scan the sky for short duration stellar variability two orders of magnitude faster than current instruments. The proposed survey - the first \textit{star trail} survey - is crucial to realizing this potential.

% This dataset will be the first of its kind. Gateway.
 
% The first component of our method is to turn off tracking and take star trail images, which almost all telescopes are capable of. The second component is to process the resulting images. We have used the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in our analysis because we ultimately aim to use the star trails taken during LSST commissioning. We use the rich LSST simulation ecosystem: OpSim, CatSim, and PhoSim - to produce realistic sequences of observations and images. We modify PhoSim to produce star trail images and stellar variability, represented by brief tophat flux bursts. Then we train a deep neural networkon to locate variability in over a hundred thousand small image crops.  
% While others have developed specialized instruments for imaging this regime, typically with frame transfer and electron multiplying CCDs, they usually have a limited field of view. We enable a unique combination of wide-field and high speed photometry by taking star trail images and processing them with a deep neural network. This method allows conventional telescopes to systematically explore the sky for fast optical phenomena and contribute to new scientific areas. 
% The next step is to validate our approach with real data. The counts make sense, see Figure 2. The differences between simulated images and real images will not only be useful for refining our technique but will also provide feedback that can improve the simulators. We also hope to employ this technique . This meets the NOAO's goal of supporting LSST pathfinder projects and also will help us prepare for LSST commissioning, where we plan to take star trail images that can be repurposed for science. 
% Finally there is a wide array of science analysis we plan to do with the data. have been topics studied with other facilities. The wide field allows us to search for serendipituous discoveries but also put upper bounds on the distribution of these objects. We expect this work to enable conventional telescopes to contribute to this new science and place upper bounds on the frequency of short duration events.

\subsection*{Observing Four Adjacent K2 Campaigns: 2,9,11,15}

The Kepler K2 mission is a sequence of 80-day continuous observing campaigns of fields distributed around the ecliptic plane. For each field, K2 provides state of the art photometry for thousands of targets. This rich data has compelled astronomers to image these fields extensively, including in the near infrared and x-ray regimes. The constituents of these fields are well known, making them excellent targets to validate our method on. Furthermore, the analysis of any rare events we uncover will benefit from the wealth of existing data.

The survey we propose covers four K2 fields: 2,9,11,15. These adjacent fields extend from the galactic plane to 35 degrees above it, providing a wide range of source densities for our method. The fields in this suite also share good observing periods. The DECam field of view almost perfectly inscribes a single Kepler Module of four CCDs. This allows us to efficiently cover the K2 fields by visiting the center locations of the modules. We tile each field 3 times in the `r' band. The first is a static exposure for reference. The following two visits take 15 second star trail exposures. We discuss these choices further in the technical description. 

\subsection*{Image Processing and Analysis}

The image processing and analysis has three stages. First we generate simulated data and train the algorithm on it. We will use the Sherlock 2.0 high performance computing cluster at Stanford University to produce a suite of simulated DECam star trail images. CatSim will be used to seed realistic catalogs; PhoSim, which has already been used to study DECam, will be used for the image simulations. Then we will train networks to detect three variable signatures: bursts, occultations, and smooth trends on timescales of tens of milliseconds to minutes.

In the second stage we calibrate the performance of the algorithm. We will insert simulated variable star trails in the real DECam images and examine the algorithm's ability to uncover them. If we discover effects in the DECam images that are not captured in the simulations, then we can set aside a partition of the real data to use in the training, which will push the network to generalize. At the end of this stage we will have established consistent performance on simulated and real images and have measured the algorithm's performance limits on the signatures of interest.

The third stage will be scanning the real DECam data and communicating the results. The variable events we find will collectively support global statistical analysis and individually be candidates for custom, detailed follow-up analysis. We will combine the variable events with the performance limits to constrain the frequency of specific short duration phenomena in our galaxy.

% OTHER FACILITIES OR RESOURCES
% 
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% Please limit to about a half page of printed text.
% 
% 1) We are interested in understanding how observations made through
% NOAO observing opportunities complement or support data from other
% facilities both on the ground and in space.   We will use this
% information to guide the evolution of the NOAO program; it will not
% affect the success of your proposal in the evaluation process.
% Please describe how the proposed observations complement data from  
% other facilities, including private observatories and both ground-
% and space-based telescopes.  In addressing this question, take a
% broad view of your research program.  Are the data to be obtained 
% through this proposal going to help select samples for detailed
% observations using larger telescopes or from space observatories?
% Are these data going to be directly combined with data obtained
% elsewhere to test a hypothesis?  Will these observations have
% relevance to other observations, even though the proposal stands
% on its own?  For each of these other facilities, indicate the nature
% of the observations (yours or those of others), and describe the
% importance of the observations proposed here in the context of the
% entire program.
%
% 2) Do you currently have a grant that would provide resources
% to support the data processing, analysis, and publication of the
% observations proposed here?

\otherfacilities

This is LSST pathfinder. We work on LSST commissioning. We have computing resources.


% LONG-TERM DETAILS
%
% If you are requesting long-term status for this proposal briefly 
% state the requirements for telescope time (telescope, instrument, 
% number of nights) needed in subsequent semesters to complete this 
% project in \longtermdetails (be sure to uncomment the 
% \longtermdetails line below).
%
% If this is a long-term request you MAY ALSO NEED to modify the
% \proposaltype keyword at the top of this form changing "Standard"
% to "Longterm" (where is says "Please do not modify or delete this 
% line!").  It is this keyword that will flag this proposal as a 
% long-term status request, regardless of what may be entered here 
% in \longtermdetails!
%
% If this is not a long-term status request then please ignore this
% section.

% PAST USE
%
% How effectively have you used the facilities available through NOAO
% in the past?
% List allocations of telescope time on facilities available through 
% NOAO to the Principal Investigator during the past 2 years, together 
% with the current status of the data (cite publications where 
% appropriate).  Mark any allocations of time related to the current

\technicaldescription

\begin{itemize}
	\item We used JSkyCalc to confirm there are good dates between May-July where all fields can be observed through a reasonable airmass. 
	\item Confirmed survey is within Blanco 4-m horizon limits.
	\item Survey should take 3 hours and 8 minutes in theory, which leaves a buffer of approximately 2 hours.
	\item We used DECam zero-magnitude and filter throughput data to model the signal to noise ratio. The choice of 15 second exposures is guided by 3 effects: background noise increases while signal is constant after source trails through so after a few 100 milliseconds SNR $\sim 1/\sqrt(t_{exp})$, we don't want trails to be significant portion of CCD, and we want a reasonable duty cycle given almost 20 second readout time.

% COORDINATE RANGES OF PRINCIPLE TARGETS   
% Use the \targetsra and \targetsdec fields to specify the range
% of right ascension (in hours) and declination (in degrees) of your
% principle targets for this observing run.
%
% For example:
%
%  \targetsra{14 to 17}
%  \targetsdec{-10 to 35}

\targetsra{X hours}			% RA range in hours
\targetsdec{Y degrees}			% Dec. range in degrees



% Use \specialrequest to describe briefly any special or non-standard
% usage of instrumentation. 
\specialrequest
We need to review the DECam community pipeline and specify which stages we need (or need to remove) for star trail images.

% If you plan to submit any Target Tables for this run they must be
% entered here.  Target Tables are required for all queue runs.

% TARGET TABLES
%
% Target Tables are required for all queue runs and are
% are optional for classically scheduled runs.  Target
% Tables, if included, are associated with each run in the observing
% run details section of the proposal form and must follow the 
% \specialrequest in each section.
%
% CT-1.3m tables require that all the fields in the target table be
% specified.  For other tables specific fields may be deleted EXCEPT 
% for the \obscomment command as mentioned below.
%
% Queue investigators should supply good coordinates
% with the \ra and \dec commands since these values may be used to
% observe your fields.
%
% Note that for iterative targets, only the parameters that need
% to be changed have to be specified.  Once a parameter is specified in
% a targettable environment, it is retained until explicitly changed.
%
% The \obscomment command is REQUIRED for each target entry and
% must be the last item; this command forces each target line to be
% printed.  If no comment is needed, leave the argument blank.
%
% The \begin{targettable}{} command for each table must contain the
% telescope/instrument-detector information for that particular run,
% i.e,. \begin{targettable}{KP-4m/ECHUV + T2KB}.
%
% HINTS: Long tables do not break across pages. If it is necessary to
% continue a table across a page you must start a new table.  Use
% /clearpage before the \begin{targettable} command for the new table.
